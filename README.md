In this module, you will watch a demonstration of running the notebooks that support the generative AI use cases discussed in the earlier modules. If you have access to an AWS account, you can use the instructions below to run the notebooks in your account.

In this module, you will go through various tasks using generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) models that are available in Amazon Bedrock. These demos are based on the architecture patterns discussed in the previous modules. You will work on examples of generating and summarizing text, question answering, and a chatbot.

Organizations can use the examples provided here and build applications on top of them to improve productivity and efficiency. The demos illustrate the use of Amazon Bedrock models by using API calls, SDKs, and open source tools, like LangChain and Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS).
